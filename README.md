# Sorthing Algorithms

## Bubble sort
* To run the bubble sort algorithm implemetation
	* $gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89 0-bubble_sort.c 0-main.c print_array.c -o bubble
	* $./bubble
*  in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case are written
## Insertion sort
* To run the Insetion sort implementation
    * $gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89 1-main.c 1-insertion_sort_list.c print_list.c -o insertion
    * $ ./insertion

* n the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case

## Selection Sort
* To run the selection sort implementation
 	* $gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89 
2-main.c 2-selection_sort.c print_array.c -o select
	* $./select
*  in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case

## Quick Sort
* To run the quic sort implementation
	* $gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89 3-main.c 3-quick_sort.c print_array.c -o quick
	* $./quick
* in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case
